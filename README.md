# TÂCHES Prompts

A collection of my favorite Claude Code prompts and prompt systems.

## Available Prompts

### [Meta-Prompting](./meta-prompting/)

A systematic approach to building complex software by delegating prompt engineering to Claude itself. Instead of telling Claude what to do, you tell Claude what you want, and it figures out how to ask itself to do it.

Perfect for complex refactoring, new features, and multi-step tasks where you want rigorous specifications without manually crafting detailed prompts.
